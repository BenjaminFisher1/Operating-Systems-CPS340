Goals for this lab: ****
1. **Learn about the different CPU scheduling algorithms**
2. **Make observations about the pros/cons of each one**
3. **Compare the algorithms using different metrics**
4. **Implement some algorithms yourself**

First, we need to trace out some CPU scheduling examples on paper, including the Gannt chart, wait time, turnaround time, and response time for each process from sample data. 

I've placed scans of my papers where I did this in the same directory as this PDF in my repo.

This lab requires we use a java application to compare different CPU scheduling algorithms. I've setup java in an Ubuntu container.

First, I cloned the repo. Now, I have to compile all java files in `src` from the project.

We get a warning about "unchecked or unsafe input files". This is just a compiler warning. I'm not concerned because this is just for the lab, not for anything too serious.

Next, we are tasked to run java GUI.

We can see it launched the GUI, just very very <sub>small.</sub> 

I can't figure out how to resize the size of the window. I was able to scale the interface in the window, but that doesn't really help if the window is tiny. So, my solution is to use the magnifier from accessibility features.

It's a temporary solution but at least I can see what I'm doing.

Now, we have a nice area to experiment with different 

algorithms.
