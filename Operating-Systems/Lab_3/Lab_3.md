This lab requires we use a java application to compare different CPU scheduling algorithms. I've setup java in an Ubuntu container.

First, I cloned the repo. Now, I have to compile all java files in `src` from the project.

We get a warning about "unchecked or unsafe input files". This is just a compiler warning. I'm not concerned because this is just for the lab, not for anything too serious.
